## Hi there! 👋

I'm Mohamed Aziz Belfaidi, a passionate software engineer from Tunis, Tunisia. I love building innovative projects that solve real-world problems.

## About Me

I’m a final-year Cloud Engineering student based in Tunis, Tunisia. My journey in tech began with a deep curiosity about how things work, which naturally led me to explore software development, cloud computing, and system automation.

I specialize in building scalable, secure, and high-performance applications, with hands-on experience in full-stack development, cloud-native architectures, and DevOps practices. I’ve worked with technologies such as Angular, React, Node.js, Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines, contributing to real-world projects ranging from e-commerce platforms and investment systems to IoT and cloud integration solutions.

I enjoy solving complex problems, automating workflows, and continuously learning new technologies. I thrive in collaborative environments and aim to create software that delivers real impact, reliability, and great user experiences.
